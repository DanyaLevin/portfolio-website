This is going to be a resume website.

Built with HTML, CSS and Javascript, obviously, as I don't know shit else.

The main cool thing will be "click to see more" thingy:
    - items sourced
        - photo
        - title
    - responsibilities
        - bulleted list
    - reported to
        - photo
        - LinkedIn profile
        - contact details?
    - achievements
        - check icons
        - punchlines
    - documents
        - diplomas
        - certificates

Deadline: July 31st, got to move on with coding from there. A hour or two per day, I guess.

Wireframe actually drawn on a piece of paper with an old pen. Helpful, I admit.

Aparently I never installed Git on Neuron, only on Mac. Ok, will install later.

Still got to do:
    - Fill in the missing content
    - Set a document name for saving and printing

Surely, there is much=much more I can do here, but I need to move on...
